[data_node]
; A list of nodes on which to deploy ECS.
;
; Examples:
; 169.154.254.23 change_to=somehost.domain.tld
; myhostname change_to=mynewname
; neighbor.local ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/local/bin/python
; knownhost.domain.tld

{% for node in facts.data_nodes -%}
    {{ node }}
{% endfor %}

; If you want the installer node to be a data node in addition to it's
; installer role, it may be necessary to allocate additional storage resources
; to the installer node's '/var' or '/' partitions, depending on the node's
; filesystem layout. For example, if you have one filesystem on a single
; partition spanning the entire disk, then your storage partition is
; probably '/'.  If you have multiple partitions for different kinds of storage
; (eg. '/var' for logs, '/usr' for programs, '/home' for userfiles) then you'll
; want to examine your filesystems to see where you can add additional space.
;
; For space estimates across different Linux distributions, please see the github page.

[install_node]
; The node from which the installer and deployment system operates. This node also
; serves all packages upon which nodes in the deployment depend when working in
; isolated "island" environments. This behavior is configurable via
; island_environment: True
;

; This is the installer Docker image. Please don't fiddle with it unless you
