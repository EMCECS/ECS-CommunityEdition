Overview
--------

If you've not discovered it yet I strongly having a look at urwid: 
http://excess.org/urwid/

Bascially its a ncurses style console library but nicely wrapped in python and
with much better support for making complex widgets.

This repo basically includes a few widgets I built to experiment with the 
library.  At the moment we have a scrollview, splitview and a tabview.
