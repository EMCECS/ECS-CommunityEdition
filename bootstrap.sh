### How to
# TODO: Add github URLs to help text (bottom)
usage() {
    log "providing usage info"
cat <<EOH

[Usage]
 -h              This help text

[General Options]
 -y / -n         Assume YES or NO to any questions (may be dangerous).

 -v / -q         Be verbose (also show all logs) / Be quiet (only show necessary output)

 -c <deploy.yml> If you have a deploy.yml ready to go, use this.

 -o <ns1[,ns2,]> Override DHCP-configured nameserver(s); use these instead. No spaces!

 -g              Install virtual machine guest agents and utilities for QEMU and VMWare.
                 VirtualBox is not supported at this time.

 -b <mirror>     Build the installer image (ecs-install) locally instead of fetching
                 the current release build from DockerHub (not recommended). Use the
                 Alpine Linux mirror <mirror> when building the image.

[Docker Options]
 -r <registry>   Use the Docker registry at <registry> instead of DockerHub.
                 The connect string is specified as '<host>:<port>[/<username>]'
                 You may be prompted for your credentials if authentication is required.
                 You may need to use -d (below) to add the registry's cert to Docker.

 -d <x509.crt>   NOTE: This does nothing unless -r is also given.
                 If an alternate Docker registry was specified with -r and uses a cert
                 that cannot be resolved from the anchors in the local system's trust
                 store, then use -d to specify the x509 cert file for your registry.

[Proxies & Middlemen]
 -k <x509.crt>   Install the certificate in <file> into the local trust store. This is
                 useful for environments that live behind a corporate HTTPS proxy.

 -p <proxy>      Use the <proxy> specified as '[user:pass@]<host>:<port>'
                 items in [] are optional. It is assumed this proxy handles all protocols.

 -t <connect>    Attempt to CONNECT through the proxy using the <connect> string specified
                 as '<host>:<port>'. By default 'google.com:80' is used. Unless you block
                 access to Google (or vice versa), there's no need to change the default.

[Examples]
 Install VM guest agents and install the corporate firewall cert in certs/mitm.pem.
    $ bash bootstrap.sh -g -k certs/mitm.pem

 Quietly use nlanr.peer.local on port 80 and test the connection using EMC's webserver.
    $ bash bootstrap.sh -q -p nlanr.peer.local:80 -t emc.com:80

 Assume YES to all questions and use the proxy cache at cache.local port 3128 for HTTP-
 related traffic. Use the Docker registry at registry.local:5000 instead of DockerHub,
 and install the x509 certificate in certs/reg.pem into Docker's trust store so it can
 access the Docker registry.
    $ bash bootstrap.sh -y -p cache.local:3128 -r registry.local:5000 -d certs/reg.pem

For additional information, read the docs on GitHub.
For additional help, please open an issue on GitHub.
