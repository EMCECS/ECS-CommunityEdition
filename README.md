## Description

EMC ECS is a stateful, containerized, object storage system for cloud storage protocols.  ECS is compatible with AWS S3 and OpenStack Swift.  On file-enabled buckets, ECS can provide NFS exports for file-level access to objects.

ECS can be set up on one or more hosts or virtual machines in a single-site or a multi-site geo replicated configuration. We want the wider community to use ECS and provide feedback.  Usage of this software is under the End User License Agreement at the bottom of this README.

ECS Community Edition is a free, reduced footprint, version of Dell EMC's ECS software. Of course, this means there are some limitations to the use of the software, so the question arises; how is the Community Edition of ECS different from the production version?

### License difference
As noted with the included license, ECS Community cannot be used in production environments and is intended to be used for trial and proof of concept purposes only. This software is still owned and protected by Dell EMC.

### Feature differences
It it important to note that ECS-Community Edition is ***not*** the same as ECS software and as such lacks some features that are integral to the actual ECS software.

* **ECS Community Edition does NOT support encryption**
* **ECS Community Edition does NOT include ECS' system management, or "fabric", layer**

### Notice
Because of these differences, ECS Community Edition is absolutely **not** qualified for testing failure scenarios. Failure scenarios can only be adequately mimicked on the full version of ECS Software.


## Quick Start Guide
If you have the following:

1. A CentOS *Minimal* install of the latest CentOS release with:
    1. 16GB RAM
    2. 16GB block device for system
    3. 104GB block device for ECS
2. Internet access
3. No proxies, local mirrors, or special Docker registries

Then you should be able to get up and going with a Single-Node All-in-One install using these commands on your VM:

```
# git clone https://github.com/EMCECS/ECS-CommunityEdition
# cd ECS-CommunityEdition
# cp docs/design/reference.deploy.yml deploy.yml
# echo "Edit this deploy.yml to match your VM's environment"
# vi deploy.yml
# ./bootstrap.sh -y -g -c deploy.yml
```

And then after the node reboots (you did use a clean minimal install from ISO or netinstall right?):

```
# step1
# step2
```

And if all went well, you now have a working stand-alone ECS, mostly configured, and ready for use.

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum
_Note: A minimum configuration is only suitable for short-term sandbox testing_
Hardware or virtual machine with:

* 4 CPU Cores
* 16GB RAM
* 16GB root block storage
* 104GB additional block storage
* CentOS Minimal installation of the latest CentOS release

### Recommended
_Note: A recommended configuration is more suitable for longer-term functional testing_
Hardware or virtual machine with:

* 8 CPU Cores
* 64GB RAM
* 16GB root block storage
* 1TB additional block storage
* CentOS Minimal installation of the latest CentOS release

## Deployment Scenarios
### Deploy into Internet-Connected Environments

#### [ECS Single-Node All-in-One Deployment (recommended, fastest, smallest footprint)](docs/source/installation/ECS-Installation.md)
Deploy a stand-alone instance of ECS to a single hardware or virtual machine.

#### [ECS Multi-Node All-in-One Deployment with Install Node (EC replication with > 3 nodes)](docs/source/installation/ECS-Installation.md)
Deploy a multi-node ECS instance to two or more hardware or virtual machines.  Three nodes are required to enable erasure-coding replication.

### Deployments into Soft-Isolated and Air-Gapped Island Environments
##### Important information regarding Island deployments
Please be aware that install node bootstrapping requires Internet access to the hardware or virtual machine that will become the install node, but once this step is complete, the machine can be removed from the Internet and migrated into the Island environment.

#### Deploying from OVA
In situations where Internet access is completely disallowed, or for the sake of convenience, an OVA of a prefabricated, bootstrapped, install node is provided.  Please download the OVA from one of the links below.

The OVA is shipped as a bootstrapped install node.  It must be cloned multiple times to create as many Data Store Nodes as desired.

###### OVA Special Requirements
* All nodes **MUST** be clones of the OVA.
* All nodes **MUST** have their virtual hardware configurations updated to match the node type requirements.
###### Default Credentials
* The default password for the `admin` accounts is `ChangeMe`. The default password for `root` is unknowable.
###### Network Configuration
* The OVA is configured to acquire network settings via DHCP.  Static configurations must be manually configured with `sudo nmtui`

##### OVA Download Links
Please see the [release page](https://github.com/EMCECS/ECS-CommunityEdition/releases) for OVA download links.

#### [ECS Single-Node Deployment with Install Node (recommended)](docs/source/installation/ECS-Installation.md)
Using an install node for isolated environments, deploy a stand-alone instance of ECS to a single hardware or virtual machine.

#### [ECS Multi-Node Deployment with Install Node](docs/source/installation/ECS-Installation.md)
Using an install node for isolated environments, deploy a multi-node ECS instance to two or more hardware or virtual machines.  Three nodes are required to enable erasure-coding replication.
