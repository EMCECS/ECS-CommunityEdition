ECS Administrative Web UI
=========================

Login to the Web UI
-------------------

The WebUI uses SSL and a self-signed certificate to help protect your
session from casual eves-dropping. Take the IP of your first ECS node,
fire up your browser, and point ``https://`` at it. For this example,
the latest Google Chrome browser was used.

While login fist time , it ask to change the root password , use the default account as below.

    Username: **root**\ Password: **ChangeMe**

Input License
-------------

Open *Settings*, then *Licensing* and upload the ``license.xml`` file
located in the ecs-single-node / ecs-multi-node folder. **The UI will
not automatically update the license view in this release.** Navigating
away from page and returning will prompt it to update. You may need to
try a few times before it updates. Once it does, you should see
something like this:

   Upload License file

Create Storage vPool
--------------------

Open *Manage*, then *Storage Pools* and create a storage pool. Keep the
name simple, and add all nodes to the pool. Click *Save*.

There's a known issue in this build that causes the Storage Pools view
to appear frozen for about 1-2 minutes after provisioning begins.
**Unlike with the license view case, this view will update on its own.**
Once it's updated, you should see something similar to:

Create Virtual Data Center
--------------------------

Open *Manage*, then *Virtual Data Center* and create a Virtual Data
Center using the below screenshot as a guide. **Please wait for up to 20
minutes after creating a Storage vPool before creating a Virtual Data
Center.** There are several background tasks that must complete, and for
object to fully initialize.
